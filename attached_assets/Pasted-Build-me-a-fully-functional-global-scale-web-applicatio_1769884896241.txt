Build me a fully functional, global-scale web application called 
“QR Ticket Approval & Event Management System”.

MAIN PURPOSE:
This app should allow students, professionals, companies, and organizers 
to create events, generate tickets, approve participants, and verify entry 
using QR codes.

CORE FEATURES:

1. USER ROLES
- Admin (Event Organizer / Company)
- Participant (Student / Professional)
- Verifier (Check-in / Check-out staff)

2. AUTHENTICATION
- Login & Signup for:
  - Admins / Companies
  - Participants / Students / Professionals
- Email + Password authentication
- Secure session handling

3. EVENT & FORM BUILDER (ADMIN PANEL)
Admins can:
- Create multiple events (Hackathons, Tech Events, College Fests, Conferences)
- Design custom registration forms dynamically using:
  - Name
  - Email ID
  - Phone Number
  - Roll Number
  - Current Semester
  - Course (Dropdown)
  - College / Company Name
  - Location Preferences
  - Custom fields (Text, Dropdown, Checkbox, File Upload, etc.)
- Save form templates for:
  - Hackathons
  - Big Events
  - College Events
- Generate a public registration link for each event

4. TICKET GENERATION SYSTEM
- Once a participant submits the form:
  - Auto-generate a unique ticket
  - Generate a unique QR code linked to that ticket
  - Generate a shareable ticket link (global access)
- Ticket should include:
  - Event Name
  - Date & Time
  - Location
  - Participant Details
  - QR Code
- Ticket should be viewable as:
  - Web ticket (mobile friendly)
  - Screenshot-friendly layout
  - Downloadable / Shareable link

5. QR CODE APPROVAL & VERIFICATION
- QR code should:
  - Be unique per participant
  - Work globally
- Verifier dashboard:
  - Scan QR code
  - Show participant details
  - Allow:
    - Check-In
    - Check-Out
- Prevent duplicate check-ins
- Show real-time status (Checked-in / Checked-out)

6. ADMIN DASHBOARD
- View all registrations
- Approve / Reject participants (optional)
- Export data (CSV)
- See analytics:
  - Total registrations
  - Checked-in users
  - Active users
- Control event settings:
  - Enable/Disable check-in
  - Enable approval-based tickets

7. TECH REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, modern, professional UI (mobile-first)
- Fully connected:
  - Frontend
  - Backend logic
  - Database
- Add sample data for testing all features
- Scalable architecture (global usage ready)

8. DATABASE
- Users
- Events
- Forms
- Tickets
- QR Codes
- Check-in / Check-out logs

9. EXTRA
- Ticket link should work without login (view-only)
- QR scan should validate in real time
- System should be extensible for future features

FINAL STEP:
After building, explain:
- How to add new fields to forms
- How to add new pages or features
- How to scale for large hackathons & enterprise events
